# LaTeX-LectureNotes

I have learned that it's better to LaTeX my lecture notes than to keep them hand-written.  Highlights:
* Uses Socratic Method - supports question-and-answer style lectures.
* Not designed for students *taking* notes, but for instructors to prepare class.
* Toggle between student version and instructor version by setting one flag.  Instructor Version hides answers to questions and solutions to some exercises.
* All relevant packages are usable on Sage Math Cloud.


At this point, there's only an .sty, not a .cls.
