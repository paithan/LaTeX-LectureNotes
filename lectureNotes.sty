%used to determine who this is being created for.
\newtoggle{forStudents}

%Used in place of \title{X} to set the title of the notes.  Usage: \lectureNotesTitle{CS 398 - Dogs and Frogs}
\newcommand{\lectureNotesTitle}[1]{\title{#1 \\ \large{Lecture Notes - \iftoggle{forStudents}{Student}{Instructor}\ Version}}}

%hwAssign
%Used to state homework assignments if they belong in the notes.
%Example: \hwAssign{3.3 problems 1, 4 and 7}
\newcommand{\hwAssign}[1]{\ensuremath{\leftrightsquigarrow HOMEWORK:} {#1} \ensuremath{\leftrightsquigarrow}}

%lecturePoint
%Currently this does nothing.  I may want it to do something in the future.
%Example: \lecturePoint{Why did Kyle write this command?}
\newcommand{\lecturePoint}[1]{#1}

%\lectureDefinition
%Used to add a definition
%Example: \lectureDefinition{monkey}{A \emph{monkey} is an awesome animal.
\newcommand{\lectureDefinition}[2]{\textbf{Def:} \underline{\emph{#1}} #2}

%question
%Used for a question to ask the class.
%Example: \question[Three]{How many sides does a triangle have?}
%%TODO: get the Q and A to be at the top of their cells!  Then remove the phantomed suit symbols!
\newcommand{\question}[2][]{
\vspace{.2in}
\framebox{
 \begin{tabular}{p{1in} l}
  \parbox[t]{\textwidth}{\textbf{\huge Q:}} & \parbox{5in}{#2} 
   \ifstrempty{#1}
    {%if #1 is empty
    }
    {%if #1 is not empty
     \iftoggle{forStudents}
      {%if forStudents is true  TODO: get this to print the A: and phantom out the other stuff.
       \\  \phantom{$\spadesuit\diamondsuit\diamondsuit\diamondsuit\diamondsuit\diamondsuit\spadesuit$} & %TODO: remove the phantomed part once you get the Q and A to go to the top.
       \\ \textbf{\huge A:} & \phantom{\parbox{4in}{#1}}
      }
      {%if forStudents is false
       \\  \phantom{$\spadesuit\diamondsuit\diamondsuit\diamondsuit\diamondsuit\diamondsuit\spadesuit$} & %TODO: remove the phantomed part once you get the Q and A to go to the top.
       \\ \textbf{\huge A:} & \parbox{4in}{#1} 
      }
    }
 \end{tabular}
}

%answer
%Sometimes you want an answer not right next to the question.  This is useful for that.
%Example: \answer{A triangle has three sides.}
\newcommand{\answer}[1]{
\vspace{.2in}
\framebox{
\begin{tabular}{rl}
  \textbf{\huge A:} & \parbox{4in}{#1} \cr
      \end{tabular}}

%lectureExample
%An example given to the class.  Currently this is not very well formatted.
%Example: \lectureExample{Right Triangle}{A triangle with sides of length 3, 4, and 5 is a right triangle.}
\newcommand{\lectureExample}[2]{
\begin{center}
 \underline{\textbf{Example: #1}} \\
 #2
\end{center}

%lectureAction
%Something done in class that isn't just speaking.
%Example: \lectureAction{Dance around like a chicken.}
\newcommand{\lectureAction}[1]{\large{\textlangle \phantom{i} {#1} \textrangle}}

%codeExample
%An example of code presented in class.  I usually use this when showing examples using an interpreter such as the Python interactive mode.
%Example: \codeExample{>>> x = 3\\>>> x\\ 3}
\newcommand{\codeExample}[1]{\begin{center}\framebox{
  \begin{minipage}{.9\linewidth}
    \texttt{#1}
  \end{minipage}}\end{center}}
  
%I don't use this anymore.  Consider it deprecated.
