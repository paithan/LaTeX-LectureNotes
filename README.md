# LaTeX-LectureNotes

I have learned that it's better to LaTeX my lecture notes than to keep them hand-written.  Highlights:
* Uses Socratic Method - supports question-and-answer style lectures.
* Not designed for students *taking* notes, but for instructors to prepare class.
* Toggle between student version and instructor version by setting one flag.  Instructor Version hides answers to questions and solutions to some exercises.
* All relevant packages are usable on Sage Math Cloud.
* lectureNotesExamples.tex has examples of all of the functionality.
* Has functionality to add a title.
* Can create groups of exercises in subsubsections.  Exercises can have answers in an appendix, with some always visible and others hidden in the student version.


At this point, there's only an .sty, not a .cls.
